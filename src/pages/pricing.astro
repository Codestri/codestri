    question: 'Can we start with an audit first?',
    answer: 'Yes. Many teams begin with an audit sprint, then execute redesign and rebuild in staged phases.',

    question: 'Are these fixed templates or flexible engagements?',
    answer: 'Flexible. These are baseline package anchors and can be adapted to your actual business priorities.',
