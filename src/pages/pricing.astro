    question: 'Can we start small and expand later?',
    answer: 'Yes. Most teams start with a focused scope, then add pages or optimization cycles once early results are clear.',

    question: 'Do these tiers lock us into one format?',
    answer: 'No. They are planning anchors, not rigid boxes. Scope is adjusted to your constraints and outcomes.',

    question: 'Is ongoing support available after launch?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Iteration support can be added for content refinement, performance tuning, and UX improvements.',
